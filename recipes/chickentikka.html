        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Chciken tikka is a savoury appetizer popular in the Indian subcontinent.</p>
        <p>It consists of bite-sized,boneless chicken pieces marinated in a spiced yogurt and grilled in a tandoor oven until charred to perfection.</p>
        <p>It is usually served with a mint or coriander chutney, alongside sliced onions and it is recommended to squeeze a lemon on top, for an  even better experience.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Marinated chicken</li>
            <li>Spices (all)</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Skewers</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine all the ingredients for the tandoori marinade in a stain proof bowl.</li>
            <li>Cut each thigh into 4 pieces. Cut each breast, if using, into 8 pieces. Combine tandoori marinade with chicken. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours.</li>
            <li>Soak skewers in water for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the lemon juice to the chicken. Mix to combine. Let stand no more than one hour.</li>
            <li>Light your grill. Build a two zone fire if using charcoal. Turn one burner to high and another to low if using gas.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from marinade. Use gloves if you have them. Tandoori marinade stains something fierce. </li>
            <li>Skewer the chicken.</li>
            <li>Grill over indirect heat until almost done - around 10-15 minutes. You want an internal temperature of about 150F for breasts or 160F for thighs at this point. You will be cooking them a bit more over direct heat. Your final target is 165F for breasts and 175F for thighs.</li>
            <li>Move chicken skewers over direct (high) heat and grill an additional 2-4 minutes, turning every minute.. You want a bit of char but you don't want it to burn or dry out.</li>
        </ol>
